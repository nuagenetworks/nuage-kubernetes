Go-Bambou provides a set of objects that allow the manipulation of ReST entities very easily. It deals with all the needed CRUD operations transparently. It is meant to be used in combination with [Monolithe](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monolithe) and a set of api specifications, like the [VSD API Specifications](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vsd-api-specifications).

Bambou will be used by the autogenerated code produced by Monolithe and will provide an interface between this generated code and the ReST api.

> Bambou needs to be able to communicate with a server that implements a specific ReST interface (will be described later).
